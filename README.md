# mix_gauss_caravan_sna
This is the simulation code used in the manuscirpt,
Koda and Matsuda "A simulation experiment to reconstruct the social structures by observing the collective movements (tentative title)".

## Requirements
This code is worked under python3 or anaconda3 with:
- Python 3.6.9 :: Anaconda, Inc.
- numpy 1.17.4 
- matplotlib 3.1.1
- scipy 1.3.2 
- networkx 2.4
- python-louvain 0.13
- Tested on Mac OS 10.15.3

## Usage
- Main code for the simulation is `collective_movement.py`.
- 2 command arguments are prepared.
- the 1-st argument is a parameter, SD ratio of independenter per depender (see explanations below for details). *Integer*.
- the 2-nd argument is a parameter, experiment number (see explanations below for details). *Integer*.
- Run the following code in your terminal.

```python collective_movement.py arg1 arg2```


## Overviews of the simulations
TBD.
